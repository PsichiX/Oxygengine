# Example of simple game made with Oxygengine

**NOTE**: This example is locked at version 0.19.2 because starting from 0.20,
engine got new ECS and system scheduler, as well as new UI module. This demo will
be ported to the latest engine version as soon as there will be time available.
Until that happen, treat this demo as a historical evidence of how things were
done in times before 0.20.
